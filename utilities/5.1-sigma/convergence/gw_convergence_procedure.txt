Silicon - BerkeleyGW
====================

In this directory, we will perform perform calculations to assess the convergence of GW calculations 
with respect to screened/dielectric cutoff and bands.

We will pretend for this example that an "infinite" number of bands used in the dielectric matrix and 
the CH summation in the self energy for Si is roughly 200, while the "infinite" G-vector cutoff is 20 Ryd. 
The actual numbers are larger, but for time considerations, we will use these numbers.

The total error we will aim for in these calculation is 200 meV. So, by the rule of thumb that the
error from the truncated bands and screened cutoff is about half the total error, we want the error
from these sources to be roughly 100 meV. At the end of this exercise we will have picked numbers of
bands in Epsilon and Sigma and a screened cutoff such that the error in the calculation from these
sources is 100 meV relative to the "infinite" limit.
 
Instructions
------------

  1. First, run the script ``./01-link_files.sh``. It will create links for the
     epsmat.h5 (dielectric matrix) files.
 
  2. We first test the convergence with respect to the number of bands used in the 
     CH summation. To do this, we must calculate the dielectric matrix in the limit
     of an infinite number of bands and G-vectors. The total number of bands we should use
     for Epsilon is 202 and the dielectric cutoff is 20 Ryd. These have already been set in the 
     ``epsilon.inp`` file, so do the following:
       a. Go to the ``1-epsilon`` directory and check the input file to make sure 
          that the number of bands and the dielectric cutoff has been set correctly. 
       b. Run the epsilon calculation using ``./01-run_epsilon.run``.
       c. Make sure that the calculation has run successfully.

  3. Now we must vary the number of bands used in the CH summation. The number of bands
     that we will use is 60, 132, and 202. These have been determined to be symmetry
     allowed by the degeneracy_check.x utility. 202 bands will be considered our "infinite"
     limit. To do this do the following:
       a. Go to the ``2-sigma`` directory and change the number of bands to 60. 
       b. Run the Sigma calculation using ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
       c. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/CH_bands/sigma.60``, i.e. use
          the command ``cp sigma_hp.log convergence/CH_bands/sigma.60``. The number 
          after the dot signifies the number of bands used in the CH summation. 
       d. Change the number of bands to 132. 
       e. Run the Sigma calculation using ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
       f. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/CH_bands/sigma.132``.
       g. Change the number of bands to 202. 
       h. Run the Sigma calculation using ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
       i. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/CH_bands/sigma.202``.
       j. Go the ``convergence/CH_bands`` directory by running 
          ``cd convergence/CH_bands``.
       k. Run the command ``module load python``, then run command 
          ``python sigma_convergence.py``. This will generate a plot
          showing the errors in many different QP gaps for the three
          different numbers of bands used in the CH summation. Some of
          the more well-studied gaps, e.g. Gamma-Gamma, Gamma-X, are labeled
          specifically and are listed in the legend. All other lines, which
          are yellow and are not in the legend, correspond to other gaps 
          that are less well studied but which nonetheless tell you
          about the non-uniform convergence of gaps, i.e. different gaps converge
          at different rates. If you do not see the plot, a png named "CH_bands_conv.png" is 
          generated, so you can use ``display CH_bands_conv.png`` to view that file. If that
          does not work either, , then use the following command to copy the file to 
          your laptop and view it there: 
          ``scp username@edison.nersc.gov:/scratch1/scratchdirs/username/2-silicon_convergence/2-bgw/2-sigma/convergence/CH_bands/CH_bands_conv.png`` 
          where username should be replaced with the user name for your training account.
          The horizontal line at 20 meV is meant as a guide to the eye. What is the 
          maximum error for the calculation using 132 bands?

    4. Now we will test the convergence with respect to the screened cutoff of the
       dielectric matrix. We have generated a dielectric matrix with a 20 Ryd cutoff,
       but we can choose to use a sub-matrix corresponding to a lower cutoff by changing
       the ``screened_coulomb_cutoff`` parameter in ``sigma.inp``. To test the convergence with respect 
       to the screened cutoff do the following: 
         a. Go to the ``2-sigma`` directory and change the ``screened_coulomb_cutoff`` to 10.0 Ryd. Check
            that the number of bands in the Sigma and Epsilon calculations are set to their 
            "infinite values". 
         b. Run the Sigma calculation using ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
         c. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/Screened_cut/sigma.10``, i.e. use
            the command ``cp sigma_hp.log convergence/Screened_cut/sigma.10``. The number 
            after the dot now signifies the screened cutoff. 
         d. Change the ``screened_coulomb_cutoff`` to 15.0. 
         e. Run the Sigma calculation using ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
         f. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/Screened_cut/sigma.15``.
         g. Change the ``screened_coulomb_cutoff`` to 20.0. 
         h. Run the Sigma calculation using ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
         i. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/Screened_cut/sigma.20``.
         j. Go the convergence/Screened_cut directory by running 
            ``cd convergence/Screened_cut``.
         k. Run the command ``python sigma_convergence.py``. This will generate
            a plot showing the errors in many different QP gaps for the three different
            values of the screened cutoff. If you do not see the plot, a png named 
            "Screened_cut_conv.png" is generated, so you can use ``display Screened_cut_conv.png`` 
            to view that file. If that does not work either, then use the following command to copy
            the file to your laptop and view it there:
            ``scp username@edison.nersc.gov:/scratch1/scratchdirs/username/2-silicon_convergence/2-bgw/2-sigma/convergence/Screened_cut/Screened_cut_conv.png`` 
            where username should be replaced with the user name for your training account.
            What is the maximum error for the calculation using a screened cutoff of 15 Ryd?

    5. Now we will test the convergence with respect to the number of bands used 
       in calculating the dielectric matrix. The number of bands that we will use is 60, 
        132, and 202. These are values that are allowed by symmetry. To test the convergence
        with respect to the number of bands in the dielectric matrix calculation do the following:
         a. Go to the ``1-epsilon`` directory and change the number of bands to 60. Check
            that number of bands in Sigma and the screened cutoff are set to their 
            "infinite values". 
         b. Run the Epsilon calculation using ``./01-run_epsilon.run``.
         c. Go to the ``2-sigma`` directory and run the Sigma calculation using 
            ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
         d. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/Epsilon_bands/sigma.60``, i.e. use
            the command ``cp sigma_hp.log convergence/Epsilon_bands/sigma.60``. The number 
            after the dot now signifies the number of bands in the epsilon calculation. 
         e. Go to the ``1-epsilon`` directory and change the number of bands to 132.
         f. Run the ``Epsilon`` calculation using ``./01-run_epsilon.run``.
         g. Go to the ``2-sigma`` directory and run the Sigma calculation using 
            ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
         h. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/Epsilon_bands/sigma.132``.
         i. Go to the ``1-epsilon`` directory and change the number of bands to 202.
         j. Run the Epsilon calculation using ``./01-run_epsilon.run``.
         k. Go to the ``2-sigma`` directory and run the Sigma calculation using 
            ``./01-run_sigma.run``. 
         l. Copy the ``sigma_hp.log`` file to ``convergence/Epsilon_bands/sigma.202``.
         m. Go the ``convergence/Epsilon_bands`` directory by running 
            ``cd convergence/Epsilon_bands``.
         n. Run the command ``python sigma_convergence.py``. This will generate 
            a plot showing the errors in many different QP different gaps for the three
            different numbers of bands used in the calculation of the dielectric matrix. 
            If you do not see the plot, a png named "Epsilon_bands_conv.png" is 
            generated, so you can use ``display Epsilon_bands_conv.png`` to view that file. 
            If that does not work either, , then use the following command to copy
            the file to your laptop and view it there:
            ``scp username@edison.nersc.gov:/scratch1/scratchdirs/username/2-silicon_convergence/2-bgw/2-sigma/convergence/Epsilon_bands/Epsilon_bands_conv.png`` 
            where username should be replaced with the user name for your training account.
            What is the maximum error for the calculation using 132 bands in the dielectric 
            matrix calculation?

    6. Now that we have calculated all the data, inspect the convergence plots for 
       the number of bands in the CH summation, the screened cutoff, and the number of bands
       in the dielectric matrix calculation. These plots can be brought back up by running the 
       ``python sigma_convergence.py`` command in the relevant directory. What value of these 
       parameters can we use to ensure a total error of roughly 100 meV from these parameters, i.e.
       total error excluding the error from the wavefunction cutoff and the q-grid?

    7. Bonus question : did we duplicate any calculations in the above procedure? Which steps
       could you omit and still have all of the needed data?

    8. Let's check what is the maximum number of bands up to which one should check convergence
       for our "infinite" value of the screened cutoff (=20 Ryd) by using ``gsphere.py``. Look
       at gsphere input file ``gsphere.inp`` and understand the different variables. Run ``gsphere.py``
       with command ``gsphere.py gsphere.inp gsphere.out`` (Note: there is no ``python`` or ``./`` before
       ``gsphere.py`` because it is in the BGW module). Open ``gsphere.out`` and look at the 
       value of the variable ``ng``. This a rough estimate for the upper bound on the number of 
       bands needed in constructing dielectric matrix and in doing the CH summation. 

    9. If you have extra time, try using the static remainder to speed up the convergence of the 
       calculation with respect to bands used in the CH summation. To do this, repeat steps 2 and 
       3 above, but when you get to step 3, add the flag ``exact_static_ch 1`` to the end of the ``sigma.inp``
       input file before running any of the calculations. Then run the calculations as described in step 
       3 above, but copy the ``sigma.60``, ``sigma.132``, and ``sigma.202`` files to the ``convergence/SR`` directory 
       and then go to ``convergence/SR`` directory, run the ``python sigma_convergence.py`` command, and 
       inspect the convergence plots as described in step 3. Is the convergence faster, as expected?
       How much less is the error for for 60 and 132 bands in comparison to when you did not use 
       the static remainder? Could you use a lower number of bands for the desired error when using
       the static remainder than when you did not?

    10. If you have still more time, using the values for the number of bands in the CH summation, 
       the screened cutoff, and the number of bands in the dielectric matrix calculation for which
       the calculation is converged (determined above), perform the convergence tests for the 
       wavefunction cutoff, and then for the q-grid. To do this you will need to go back to the 
       mean-field directories to calculate the wavefunctions for different cutoffs and q-grids. 
       What are reasonable values to test for the wavefunction cutoff and the q-grid? You can 
       use the ``convergence/WFN_cut`` and ``convergence/q-grid`` directories and the ``sigma_convergence.py``
       scripts that are located within those directories to make your convergence plots. For the 
       "sigma.x" files, where x is a number, it is recommended that you use x = wavefunction cutoff 
       for the wavefunction cutoff convergence tests, and x = linear dimension of q-grid, i.e. x=2 
       for a 2x2x2 q-grid, for the q-grid convergence tests.
