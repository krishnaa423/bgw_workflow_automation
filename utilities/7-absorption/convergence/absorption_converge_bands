Silicon (2) - 2-bgw/4-absorption/converge_bands
===============================================

There are four major convergence parameters in a Bethe-Salpeter equation
calculations, the number of:
   1. Bands on the coarse grid
   2. k-points on the coarse grid
   3. Bands on the fine grid
   4. k-points on the fine grid

The optical absorption spectrum of silicon is fairly easy to converge, so we
will instead study how the spectrum changes as we *worsen* some of the
convergence parameters. In this example, we will study how the spectrum
is affected by worsening convergence parameter (3).

Remember that, when you perform a calculation, you should check if all those 4
parameters are converged!


Instructions
------------

   1. Run ``./01-link_files.sh`` to link the ``WFN``, ``bsemat.h5`` and ``epsmat.h5`` files.

   2. Edit ``absorption.inp`` and fill in the missing parameters.

   3. Compare the ``absorption.inp`` file with your previous file. What's the
      difference?

   4. Run ``./02-run_absorption.run`` to launch the absorption calculation.
      While you wait: how do you expect your results to change as we decreased
      the number of bands?

   5. Compare the ``absorption_noeh.dat`` file with the previous version,
      and ``absorption_eh.dat`` against the previous previous. What changed?
      Is the calculation with one valence and one conduction band converged?
