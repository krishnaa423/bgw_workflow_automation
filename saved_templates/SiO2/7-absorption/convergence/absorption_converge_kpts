Silicon (2) - 2-bgw/4-absorption/converge_kpts
==============================================

There are four major convergence parameters in a Bethe-Salpeter equation
calculations, the number of:
   1. Bands on the coarse grid
   2. k-points on the coarse grid
   3. Bands on the fine grid
   4. k-points on the fine grid

In this example, we will study how the spectrum is affected by worsening
convergence parameter (4).

Remember that, when you perform a calculation, you should check if all 4
parameters are converged!


Instructions
------------

   1. Go to subdirectories ``wfn_fi/`` and ``wfnq_fi/`` to generate new
      fine-grid wave function files. Follow the instructions in the
      corresponding README files.

   2. Run ``./01-link_files.sh`` to link the ``WFN``, ``bsemat.h5`` and ``epsmat.h5`` files.

   3. Edit ``absorption.inp`` and fill in the missing parameters.

   4. Run ``./02-run_absorption.run`` to launch the absorption calculation.
      While you wait: how do you expect your results to change as we decreased
      the number of k-points? How do the previous and the new k-point sampling
      compare?

   5. Compare the ``absorption_noeh.dat`` file with the previous version,
      and ``absorption_eh.dat`` against the previous previous. What changed?
      Is this new calculation converged with respect to k-point sampling?
